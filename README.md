**Banking Customer Behavior & Wealth Analysis**
This project explores the relationships between various banking products, customer demographics, and asset accumulation. By performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we identify key correlations that define the financial lifecycle of customers—from liquid savings to long-term debt and property ownership.

 Key Insights from EDA
1. The Wealth Cluster (High Liquidity Correlation)
There is a significant positive correlation among Bank Deposits, Checking Accounts, Savings Accounts, and Foreign Currency Accounts.
Takeaway: Customers do not typically silo their wealth; those with high liquidity in one area tend to maintain substantial balances across the entire banking ecosystem.

2. The Financial Lifecycle Trend
We observed moderate correlations between Age, Estimated Income, and various account balances (Superannuation, Savings, Checking).
Insight: As income and age increase, we see a predictable rise in retirement funds (Superannuation) and credit utilization. This validates the "accumulation phase" of the standard financial lifecycle.

3. Business vs. Personal Debt
While Business Lending shows a moderate link to Bank Loans, it remains largely uncorrelated with personal deposit metrics or property ownership.
Takeaway: Business banking represents a distinct customer segment. Business owners' personal liquidity doesn't always mirror their business debt levels, suggesting these accounts are managed under different financial strategies.

4. The Property Ownership Outlier
Property Ownership shows a surprisingly low correlation with other banking variables.
Insight: Real estate holdings appear to be influenced by external factors (inheritance, market location, or timing) rather than just the liquid cash flow or income captured in this dataset.
